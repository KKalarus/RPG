nothing in here that might interest you, doing this for school.

V1.0 - Added fully working shops, skills now working
V1.0.1 - Fixed some bugs with stats not working properly
:bug: Attack, HP and Mana now resize properly after change in stats due to LVL up or adding free points:bug:

:bug: Set skill points cap at 100 + items to prevent 100% dodge/crit chance :bug:
